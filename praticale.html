 <p><h1>Mobileye was founded in 1999 by Hebrew University professor Amnon Shashua when he evolved 
    his academic research into a vision system which could detect vehicles using a camera and software algorithms on a processor. 
    Since its establishment, it has developed into a supplier of automotive safety technologies based on adding "intelligence" to 
    inexpensive cameras for commercialization.</p>

        HTML5 includes detailed processing models to encourage more interoperable implementations; it extends, improves, and rationalizes 
        the markup available for documents and introduces markup and application programming interfaces (APIs) for complex web applications. 
        For the same reasons, HTML5 is also a candidate for cross-platform mobile applications because it includes features designed with 
        low-powered devices in mind

        Header tags, also known as heading tags, are used to separate headings and subheadings on a webpage. They rank in order of 
        importance, from H1 to H6, with H1s usually being the title. Header tags improve the readability and SEO of a webpage.

        While technology contributes to economic development and improve human prosperity, it can also have negative impacts like 
        pollution or resource depletion, or may cause social harms like technological unemployment resulting from automation. As a 
        result, there are ongoing philosophical and political debates about the role and use of technology, the ethics of technology, 
        and ways to mitigate potential downsides.

        Technological advancements have led to significant changes in society. The earliest known technology is the stone tool, 
        used during prehistoric times, followed by the control of fire, which contributed to the growth of the human brain and the 
        development of language during the Ice Age. The invention of the wheel in the Bronze Age allowed greater travel and the 
        creation of more complex machines. More recent technological inventions, including the printing press, telephone, and the 
        Internet, have lowered barriers to communication and ushered in the knowledge economy.

        What is Lorem Ipsum?
        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy 
        text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has 
        survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was 
        popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop 
        publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
